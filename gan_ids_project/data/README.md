# /data

This directory contains all network traffic data used throughout the project.

## Subdirectories:

- `raw/`:  
  Raw, unprocessed network traffic datasets (e.g., CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15). These files are downloaded as-is and not modified.

- `processed/`:  
  Cleaned and transformed versions of the raw datasets. Includes normalized numeric features, encoded categorical variables, and train/test splits. Used for model input.

- `synthetic/`:  
  Synthetic attack and benign samples generated by the GAN (CTGAN/TVAE). These augment the original data for training and evaluation.

> ðŸ“Œ Note: You should never modify files in `raw/`. Use scripts in `src/preprocessing` to generate `processed/` from it.
